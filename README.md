- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stonie 'Torch' Malony
- ðŸ“« you can reach me on facebook https://www.facebook.com/StonieMalony

I am sunday programmer, most of the time I got no idea what I am doing :) ... on normal time I am working in contruction site, this is what happens if you are in place where you have to choose a path for your life and you choose path less traveled :) now I just got no idea where Im at or why :) 

in this will be place I will share my code ... I am kind of building my own smarthouse systems and if somebody is doing something similar this code is helpful in any way then I am well happy :)

Im also sunday miner and here I share my php script that monitors rewards in ezil mining pool (through public api) and writes them in local sql db ... I am sure if you can understand my code you can fill in the caps of what kind of table you need and so on. *the first thing here :)*
